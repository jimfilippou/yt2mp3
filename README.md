## Synopsis

yt2mp3 is a python CLI for downloading music from youtube.

<a id="prerequisites"></a>
## Prerequisites

You'll need to have Python 2.x installed. The rest of the requirements should be handled by the installation script.

<a id="installation"></a>
## Installing

You can run the app straight from the project's root directory without installing anything by running `app.py`. You'll need the dependencies, however, so before you run the app, run this command from that directory:

```
python setup.py -v -n
```

If that doesn't work and the app crashes because it can't find a module it needs, you should install the app as a library.

To use the app as a library, you can install it by running this command from the project's root directory:

```
python setup.py install
```

## Usage

To run the app, start a command prompt, change the current working directory to the project directory, and run this command:

```
python app.py
```

The app will give you the command prompt

```
(<yt2mp3> -> )
```

To see a list of the app's commands, type `help`.

To see the details of a command, type `help <command>`. For example, for more information on the `help` command, type `help help`.

To quit the app, use the command `q`.
